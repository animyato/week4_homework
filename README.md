# week4_homework

I don't know if I did everything correctly, but I made 
my front end to do requests to my database with axios.

I couldn't push everything to git because there were some problems with pushing this project. 
So there's only the backend part with all crud operations.

If there is interest I can show how I connected everything with frontend

Best regards,
